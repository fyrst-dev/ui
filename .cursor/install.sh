# 3. Build the publishable packages (preset, components, Nuxt module) and
#    assemble root dist/. The playground panda config and Nuxt module resolve
#    @fyrst/ui exports from that dist. `build:nuxt` (prepack) already runs
#    `nuxt-module-build prepare`, so packages/nuxt/.nuxt/tsconfig.json is
#    generated here.
#
#    Do not run `dev:nuxt:prepare` on a clean tree: it calls assemble-dist
#    before packages/components/dist exists. After a real build it would also
#    stub the module (`nuxt-module-build build --stub`) and overwrite prepack
#    output.
bun run build

# 4. Generate playground Nuxt types (.nuxt) from the built package.
#    Run nuxi prepare only — not the full module `dev:prepare`, which stubs
#    the just-built module. Disable telemetry so nuxi cannot hang on the
#    first-run consent prompt in a non-interactive Cloud Agent install.
(cd packages/nuxt && NUXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 bunx nuxi prepare playground)

# 5. Generate the playground's Panda styled-system codegen so the dev server
#    can resolve `styled-system/*` imports.
(cd packages/nuxt/playground && bun run prepare)
